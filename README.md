# 📅 Daily-Leetcode: 30-Day DSA Challenge

Welcome to my **Daily-Leetcode** repository!  
This project is part of my **30-day challenge** to consistently solve LeetCode problems and sharpen my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** skills. As a **B.Tech Computer Science student**, I'm using this challenge to build strong problem-solving habits and prepare effectively for placement drives and technical interviews.

## 🚀 Goal

✅ Solve at least **1 problem daily** for 30 days  
✅ Focus on **Easy** and **Medium** level questions  
✅ Master fundamental topics like:
- 🔢 Arrays
- 🔡 Strings
- 🧠 Storing Techniques
- 🔁 Loops & Logic Building
- 📚 Basic Algorithms

---

## 📁 Structure

Each folder is named by **day** (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, ...) and contains:
- ✅ Code solution (Java / Python / C++)
- ✍️ Problem statement or link
- 📝 My approach and explanation (in comments or Markdown)

---

## 💡 Why This Challenge?

- To demonstrate **consistency and discipline**
- To create a visible record of my **problem-solving journey**
- To strengthen **coding confidence** before placement interviews
- To build a habit of writing **clean, readable, and efficient code**

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- LeetCode (Problem Platform)
- Java / Python / C++ (Primary Languages)
- Git & GitHub (Version Control & Public Profile)

---

## 🎯 Outcome

By the end of this challenge, I aim to:
- Solve **30+ quality problems**
- Be better prepared for **technical rounds**
- Show proof of **dedication and consistency** to interviewers
